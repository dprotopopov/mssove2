This three-page application displays grouped items, item and group details in separate pages
 and supports navigating pages in the Windows 8 UI manner.
The major benefits of the DXGridApp project template, used to create this application,
 compared to the standard Grid App template are as follows:
- The template generates much less code, helping you to quickly understand the application's
 infrastructure - Much of the UI-specific functionality is already implemented in our WinRT libraries.
- Pure MVVM support without using code-behind logic - All logic including navigation
 through pages and saving/restoring a page state is implemented in View Models.
- Automatic handling of application state changes - When the Snapped view is activated,
 the application's layout is automatically changed by showing only controls displaying brief information.
- Automatic saving/restoring a scroller position when navigating pages.
